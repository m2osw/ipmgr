#
# Configuration file options available to the ipmgr tool


# dns_ip=<ip>
#
# The IP address to connect to your DNS server via nsupdate.
#
# The IP can be specified as an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
#
# Default: 127.0.0.1
#dns_ip=127.0.0.1


# zone_directories=<path>
#
# The list of directories to search for zone configuration files.
#
# Default: "/usr/share/ipmgr/zones /etc/ipmgr/zones /var/lib/ipmgr/zones"
#zone_directories=/usr/share/ipmgr/zones /etc/ipmgr/zones /var/lib/ipmgr/zones


# slave=<true | false>
#
# Whether this server is a slave or the master DNS.
#
# In this case, the `dns_ip` is used as the IP of the master DNS.
#
# TBD: can we set a value when it's just a flag? or does it just need to
#      appear on its own
#
# Default: false
#slave=false


# default_group=<name>
#
# A group default name. This is used to separate groups of domain names
# when saving them in the destination zones directories.
#
# This parameter defaults to "domains" if not defined.
#
# Since this generates a directory filename, make sure not to use special
# characters in the name (i.e. spaces, slashes, etc.).
#
# Default: domains
#default_group=domains


# default_hostmaster=<email>
#
# The email address of the hostmaster to save along the domain name (in the
# SOA).
#
# This parameter is mandatory. It should be defined by your administrator
# in the `/etc/ipmgr.d/50-ipmgr.conf` file. It can be overwritten on a
# per domain basis.
#
# This email address is expected to be set to a regular email address with
# an '@' separating the name of the user and the domain name.
#
# Default: hostmaster@<domain>
#default_hostmaster=


# default_ips="<ip1> <ip2> ..."
#
# A list of one or more IP addresses to use as the default for all the
# domain listed on this system. The system supports IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
#
# Default: <undefined>
#default_ips=


# default_ttl=<duration>
#
# The default TTL of a domain name DNS information.
#
# The duration is in seconds by default. You may append 's' for seconds,
# 'm' for minutes, 'h' for hours, 'd' for days, or 'w' for weeks.
#
# Default: 1d
#default_ttl=1d


# default_refresh=<duration>
#
# The default amount of time a secondary server can cache a DNS block.
#
# This TTL is only for secondary servers, not for an end user client
# who instead uses the `default_ttl` parameter.
#
# The duration is in seconds by default. You may append 's' for seconds,
# 'm' for minutes, 'h' for hours, 'd' for days, or 'w' for weeks.
#
# Default: 3h
#default_refresh=3h


# default_retry=<duration>
#
# The default amount of time between attempts at gathering a zone by a
# secondary server.
#
# The duration is in seconds by default. You may append 's' for seconds,
# 'm' for minutes, 'h' for hours, 'd' for days, or 'w' for weeks.
#
# Default: 3m
#default_retry=3m


# default_expire=<duration>
#
# Amount of time to continue to use a stalled IP address. This is used
# by the secondary servers to know whether an IP should still be returned
# to end users when the master DNS can't be contacted once a DNS zone
# is out of date (after `default_refresh` seconds).
#
# The duration is in seconds by default. You may append 's' for seconds,
# 'm' for minutes, 'h' for hours, 'd' for days, or 'w' for weeks.
#
# Default: 2w
#default_expire=2w


# default_minimum_cache_failures=<duration>
#
# The amount of time a secondary server has to wait between failures before
# trying again to retrieve a DNS zone from the master.
#
# The duration is in seconds by default. You may append 's' for seconds,
# 'm' for minutes, 'h' for hours, 'd' for days, or 'w' for weeks.
#
# Default: 5m
#default_minimum_cache_failures=5m


# default_nameservers="<ns1> <ns2> ..."
#
# A list of two or more name servers that can respond to requests for one
# or more of your domain names. As per the Internet rules, you must have
# at least two domain name servers for redundancy. Of course, if your
# master DNS service runs on the same server as your websites and the
# whole server is down, getting IP addresses will not serve you at all...
#
# By default, the domain name servers are set to:
#
#     ns1.<domain>
#     ns2.<domain>
#
# works well if you have a single domain name. If you have many, the default
# probably won't work at all for you.
#
# Default: ns1.${domain} ns2.${domain}
#default_nameservers=
